# Websockets

WebSocket is a computer communications protocol that allows for two-way communication between a client and server over a single connection.

# how it works
WebSockets create a persistent connection that can last indefinitely, allowing the client and server to send data at any time with minimal overhead.

# benefits
WebSockets address many limitations of the HTTP protocol, which requires multiple HTTP calls and TCP connections for bidirectional communication. WebSockets provide an alternative to the continuous polling that HTTP requires.
